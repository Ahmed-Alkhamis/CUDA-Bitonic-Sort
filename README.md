CUDA Bitonic SortA high-performance parallel implementation of the Bitonic Sort algorithm using NVIDIA CUDA. This program sorts integers on the GPU and includes a mechanism to handle arbitrary array sizes by automatically padding data to the nearest power of two.📖 OverviewBitonic sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that focuses on converting a random sequence of numbers into a bitonic sequence (one that monotonically increases then decreases), which is then merged to produce a sorted sequence.Because Bitonic sort relies on a butterfly network of comparisons, it is highly parallelizable, making it ideal for GPU architectures.Key FeaturesParallel Execution: Offloads sorting comparisons to the GPU using CUDA kernels.Dynamic Padding: Automatically handles input sizes that are not powers of two ($N \neq 2^k$) by padding with sentinel values.Flexible Input:Manual entry of integers.Random generation of data.Sorting Direction: Supports both Ascending and Descending orders.⚙️ PrerequisitesTo compile and run this project, you need:Hardware: An NVIDIA GPU (Compute Capability 2.0 or higher recommended).Software:CUDA Toolkit installed.nvcc (NVIDIA CUDA Compiler).A C/C++ compiler (gcc/g++ or MSVC).
